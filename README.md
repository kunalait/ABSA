ANALYSIS OF ASPECT BASED CUSTOMER SENTIMENTS IN HOTEL REVIEWS THROUGH NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TECHNIQUES
Sentiment analysis of reviews can determine the opinion (positive/negative/neutral) of a user about an organisation/entity (restaurant) on the whole but not the subject/attributes (food, service, ambience etc.) specifically. Determining the aspects related to the user sentiment is way more actionable from the business point of view rather than just overall sentiment as the users might have good things to say about few things and complaints/bad comments about some other things. It will also help customers in deciding better which place/entity to choose for specific needs.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37552968/152704937-bdb01b02-86c4-40eb-9825-1d70611f6cf8.png)
